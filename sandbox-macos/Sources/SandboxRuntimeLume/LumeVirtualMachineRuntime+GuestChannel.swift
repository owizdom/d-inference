/// Adoption of the guest vsock channel Lume patch 0005 hands over.
///
/// Patch 0005 connects to the guest's listening port once the agent binds it,
/// then passes the connected descriptor back over the inherited control socket
/// with `SCM_RIGHTS`. Until this file existed nothing on the host ever received
/// it: `SandboxManagedProcess.receiveGuestChannelDescriptor()` was public with
/// no callers, so the channel was created and immediately dropped.
///
/// Three properties of the handover shape everything here.
///
/// It is **one-shot**. Patch 0005 retries the connect on a long deadline but
/// returns after the first success, so a VM gets exactly one descriptor for the
/// life of its `lume run`. There is no reconnect: a channel that closes is gone
/// until the VM is restarted.
///
/// It is **optional**. Only a VM this process spawned can have one — a VM found
/// already running has spent its single handover, possibly in another process.
/// Absence is a normal state to be fallen back from, never an error.
///
/// It is **long-lived**. The agent serves many sequential commands on one
/// connection, so a single client is created once and multiplexes everything.
